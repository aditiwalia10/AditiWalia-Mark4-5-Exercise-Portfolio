            There was a time when seeing what someone else wore and how they wore it was interesting. Picture it: Stylish people, going about their day, captured by a photographer who appreciated their stand-out look. It was unique and inspirational. But then ‘street style’ came along. That is, not the style of a person who happens to be on the street, but the orchestrated influencer images we are Insta-inundated with today. And eventually, it all became a little bit the same.

            <h2>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>
            <p>
                “There’s a huge gap between emulating [street style photography pioneer] Bill Cunningham and what’s happening now,” says Gio Staiano, a seasoned photographer of the shows, who works with The New York Times and Now Fashion, among others. “Bill was chasing people down the street who had style and somehow they mixed things up. Sometimes he did a piece based on color or the similarities of what people wore; that was interesting.”

                The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to
                have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a
                pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin.
                It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is
                also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European
                languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the
                relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not
                attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the
                layout.
