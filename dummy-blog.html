            There was a time when seeing what someone else wore and how they wore it was interesting. Picture it: Stylish people, going about their day, captured by a photographer who appreciated their stand-out look. It was unique and inspirational. But then ‘street style’ came along. That is, not the style of a person who happens to be on the street, but the orchestrated influencer images we are Insta-inundated with today. And eventually, it all became a little bit the same.

            <h2>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>

                “There’s a huge gap between emulating [street style photography pioneer] Bill Cunningham and what’s happening now,” says Gio Staiano, a seasoned photographer of the shows, who works with The New York Times and Now Fashion, among others. “Bill was chasing people down the street who had style and somehow they mixed things up. Sometimes he did a piece based on color or the similarities of what people wore; that was interesting.”
            </p>

            <h2>
                Incomprehensibility or readability? <small>That is the question.</small>
              </h2>

                It was, in one word, authentic: That woman was actually crossing the road; that man was actually waiting outside a restaurant for a friend; the person was actually on the phone with someone. But that’s all changed. Now, it’s not unfamiliar to see someone be asked to walk down the street again and again to create the 'perfect,' seemingly 'natural' shot.
                “Social media has had a huge impact [on this]," says street style photographer Dvora, who has shot regularly for Vogue.co.uk. "Globalization leaves for less individualism." And that's an astute observation. Full looks (a whole outfit direct from the runway), once reserved only for the pages of magazines, are now a mode of ‘street style.' How many street style images do you see on your social media feed that depict not only the same type of outfit (either polished, put-together, and pristine, or loud and overly-layered) but the same stance, the same face, the same...everything?
